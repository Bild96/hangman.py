# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hangman Game
A simple, basic visual of hangman game. Everyone can test thier vocabulary by guessing letters one at a time to solve the word puzzle. This is version of the classic letter guessing game, to save the hanging man from death. You are shown a set of blank letters that match a word or phrase and you have to guess what these letters are to reveal the hidden word. (the image is a computer drawn version)
